> 1. Get Leghold up. This can be done through Leghold or Injurious Dust + Curious Bloom, which also breaks a shield.
> 2. Heal / prevent status. Anyone can heal with Herb of Clarity, Alfyn can prevent with Soothing dust + Curious bloom.
> 3. Set up turn 2 Aelfics. You need to Pom Therion & defend with him if he's before Ophilia. Worst case, you can Soothing Seed + Curious Bloom Therion to put him before Ophilia.
> 4. Break 1 shield off Steorra. Can be done with any character that has a free turn. This can also be done next turn.
>
> Despite all this text, this fight is pretty easy. You generally have multiple free turns. Just need to get a feel for it.

##### Turn 1
 * Ophilia: Heal status / Pom S Therion / Fire/Ice/Thunder M / Ignis
 * Tressa: Heal status / Leghold / Donate BP Therion
 * Therion: Defend / Heal status / Pom S self
 * Alfyn: Soothing Dust + Curious Bloom / Heal Status / Injurious Dust + Curious Bloom

> Take note of whether or not Alfyn Peacocks Ophilia before she does Ignis

##### Turn 2
 * Therion: Aelfics Ophilia
 * Ophilia: Ignis Ardere
 * Tressa: Mercenaries if you need to break shield / Grape M
 * Alfyn: Peacock Strut x2 Ophilia

> Revitilizing Jam has to be after Ophilia's turn. If Ophilia is last, have Therion defend and use it T4. Therion's turn is the least valuable T4.
> Note that if you used Revitalizing Jam for Dreisang, you need to use a Pom L + Refreshing Jam instead.

##### Turn 3
 * Ophilia: Ignis Ardere x4
 * Tressa: Collect x4
 * Therion: Grape M if not done already / Revitalizing Jam Ophilia / Defend
 * Alfyn: Grape M if not done already / Revitalizing Jam Ophilia / Defend

> Fight changes depending on amount of shield on Steorra. 4S is free, 8S is slightly harder, 12S is the worst one.
> You need someone between Ophilia T4 and T5 to give him 1 BP. Should always be possible with 4 & 8 shields, and possible most of the time with 12 shields.
> If you need to use Revitilizing Jam, try to use it with Therion.
> If you get 12S, someone needs to be able to give Ophilia 1BP between his turns T4 and T5. If not, you need an extra 2 L Stones + Amputation to kill. In this case, you might just want to have Tressa Leghold T4, finish break T5, and finish T6 with a Holy Light or something.

##### Turn 4
 * __Pay attention to number of shields Steorra has left__
 * Ophilia: Tenebrae x4 (4), Tonitrus x4 (8), Ignis x4 (12)
 * Tressa: Defend / Donate BP (4/8), Rain of Arrows (12)

> Maw and Lyblac die to 2 Aebers. Blade dies to 1 Aebers + 1 Aebers with either Corrosive or Panther Dance. Try to avoid doing Panther Dance before the first Aebers as a Crit might put Lyblac into red and she can wreck your party.

##### Turn 0 (Therion 1st)

> Make sure that Lyblac is after Blade next turn. Else Blade will hit AoE and kill Therion.
> If you get this pattern you'll need 1 Plum on Therion
